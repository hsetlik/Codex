TODO:
1. ~~Set up transcriptStore to store a list of transcript chunk GUIDS for the selected content and the current chunk index~~
2. ~~Components to represent Term, UserTerm, and AbstractTerm~~
3. ~~Components to represent a transcript chunk (how will term components be organized/ laid out?)~~
4. Figure out a way to include whitespace and punctuation in how words are displayed w/o including either in the terms themselves
5. Figure out how the client will request & update UserTerm details

OTHER ISSUES:
1. Routing outside of TSX (redirecting to home page after successsful login etc)
2. Need loading components, esp. for content feed
